 Usage: Put your codefile to units/ directory and add one line to test.cfg file in format 
 <mytest.k15 expected_result>. test.sh allways runs every code that has corresponding line in 
test.cfg. Tests with multi module programs also works: create new directory to units/ folder and copy 
all codefiles to that directory. Then add line to test.cfg <mydirectory expecter result> 
NOTE: mytest.k15 and mydirectory in examples are relative to units/ directory!
