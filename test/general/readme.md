##General tests for programs that prints only one output value##

In this directory you can test software that consists of one code file and outputs only one 
number!

Usage: Put your codefile to units/ directory and add one line to test.cfg file in format 
<mytest.k15 expected_result>. test.sh allways runs every code that has corresponding line in 
test.cfg
