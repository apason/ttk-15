## Building a binary with debug flags ##

# binary header #
+------------------+---------------+-------------+-----+-------------+
| length of header | data[1] start | data[1] end | ... | data[n] end |
+------------------+---------------+-------------+-----+-------------+

# compiling in debug mode #
    * every label position is stored in a table and placed in the end of a created object file

# debug label table #
+---------------------------+------------+
| address of the used label | label name |
+---------------------------+------------+

# linking in debug mode #
    * the debug label tables in the object files are updated with module constants and placed all together in the end of the finished binary file
    * in debug mode starts and ends of the data area in modules are also placed in the header of the binary file
