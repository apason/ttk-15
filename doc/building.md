#building#
There is makefile in the project root. To build just run that makefile with some gnu make compatible building software. (with gnu make just type "make" in the project root).
When build is done, binaries can be found in target/ directory.

NOTE! ttk-15 debugger uses ncurses for interaction so there must be ncurses development libraries available when building this project.

NOTE! gcc is also needed to build ttk-15 (It is defined in makefile)
